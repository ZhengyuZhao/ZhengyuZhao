I am Zhengyu Zhao, a postdocÂ at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en/about), Germany.
My general research interest is <strong>Machine Learning Security & Privacy</strong>; Most of my work has concentrated on analyzing the vulnerability of deep neural networks to various attacks, e.g., (test-time) adversarial examples and (training-time) data poisons.
